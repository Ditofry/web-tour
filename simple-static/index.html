    <div class="info-block">
      <p>The HTML now has a bunch of classes and id's.  Classes and id's are 
      just strings, and pretty much any old string will do.  Classes can exist
      in multiple places, ids exist in only one place.</p>  
      
      <p>Classes/IDs don't mean anything unless they're targeted by CSS, (makes things pretty),
      or Javascript (makes the page do stuff).  We don't have Javascript or CSS
      yet.  That's why this page looks like poo.</p>
